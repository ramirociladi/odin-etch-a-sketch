# Etch-a-Sketch Project

The "Etch-a-Sketch" project is a web-based application that allows users to draw pictures by moving the mouse over a grid of squares. This project is part of The Odin Project's web development curriculum and is designed to teach fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Overview

The project emphasizes the use of JavaScript to dynamically create and modify HTML elements in response to user input. Key skills include event handling, DOM manipulation, loops and control flow, and object-oriented programming.

# Requirements

To run the project, you will need a modern web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox) and a text editor. No additional libraries or frameworks are required.

# Installation and Usage

To get started, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The grid of squares will be displayed, and you can begin drawing by moving the mouse over the squares. The user can also change the size of the grid and clear the drawing.
