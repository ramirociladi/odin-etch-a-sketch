# Etch-a-Sketch Project

The "Etch-a-Sketch" project is a web-based application that allows users to draw pictures by moving the mouse over a grid of squares. This project is part of The Odin Project's web development curriculum and is designed to teach fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The project aims to put into practice web development skills such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, it emphasizes the use of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically create and modify HTML elements in response to user input.

The project requires several key JavaScript skills, including:

- Event handling: capturing user input (e.g. mouse movements) and responding to it in real time
- DOM manipulation: creating, modifying, and deleting HTML elements to update the display of the grid and user's drawing
- Loops and control flow: using loops and conditionals to efficiently generate and manipulate the grid of squares
- Object-oriented programming: creating reusable and modular code by encapsulating functionality into objects and methods.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need a modern web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox) and a text editor. No additional libraries or frameworks are required.

## Installation and Usage

To get started, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The grid of squares will be displayed, and you can begin drawing by moving the mouse over the squares. The user can also change the size of the grid and clear the drawing.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to submit a pull request. Bug reports and feature requests are also welcome.
